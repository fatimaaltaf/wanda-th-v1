# Wanda Front-End Challenge

## Assumptions ü§î

* Create a search tool directory where users can add a profile with a website link and more information about their expertise 
* One view for profile with only name, shortened URL, and user expertise info displayed in the profile to create a cleaner UI.
* Due to not having enough time to complete the data scrape feature, I put in a field for users to manually add their expertise which is searchable. 
* Profile information is searchable via the search filter bar. 

## If I had more time ‚è∞:

* Implement data scrape for user-inputted website (for h1-h3 tags) that would then display in profile view. 
* Dynamically render success and error messages. 
* Use redux to manage state of data for application scalability. 
* Create login/sign-up to authorize appropriate user viewing profile and having delete capability.
